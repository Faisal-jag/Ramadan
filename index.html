                • The four Sunni schools state: If one who is fasting (sa'im)
                falls ill, or fears the aggravation of his illness, or delay in
                recovery, he has the option to fast or refrain. Iftar is not
                incumbent upon him; it is a relaxation and not an obligation in
                this situation. But where there is likelihood of death or loss
                of any of the senses, iftar is obligatory for him and his
                fasting is not valid.
              </td>
              <td data-label="Imami">
                • The Imamis observe: Fasting is not valid if it would cause
                illness or aggravate it, or intensify the pain, or delay
                recovery, because illness entails harm (darar) and causing harm
                is prohibited (muharram). Moreover, a prohibition concerning an
                `ibadah (a rite of worship) invalidates it. Hence if a person
                fasts in such a condition, his fast is not valid (sahih). A
                predominant likelihood of its resulting in illness or its
                aggravation is sufficient for refraining from fasting. As to
                excessive weakness, it is not a justification for iftar as long
                as it is generally bearable. Hence the extenuating cause is
                illness, not weakness, emaciation or strain, because every duty
                involves hardship and discomfort.

                • The journey should commence before dawn and the traveler
                should have reached the point from where salat becomes qasr
                before dawn. Hence if he commences the journey after the setting
                in of dawn, it is haram for him to break the fast, and if he

                optional and not compulsory. Therefore, a traveller who fulfils
                all the conditions has the option of fasting or iftar. This is

                Therefore, if he fasts, he will have to perform the qada'
                without being liable to kaffarah. This is if he starts his
                journey before midday, but if he starts it at midday or later,
                he will keep his fast and in the event of his breaking it will
                be liable to the kaffarah of one who deliberately breaks his
                fast. <br />
                And if a traveler reaches his hometown, or a place where he
                intends to stay for at least ten days, before midday without
                performing any act that breaks the fast, it is wajib upon him to

                As mentioned earlier, fasting in the month of Ramadan is wajib
                for each and every mukallaf. Every sane adult (al-baligh
                al-`aqil) is considered mukallaf. Hence fasting is neither wajib
                upon an insane person in the state of insanity nor is it valid
                if he observes it. As to a child, it is not wajib upon him,
                though valid if observed by a mumayyiz. Also essential for the
                validity of the fast are Islam and niyyah (intention).
                Therefore, as per consensus, neither the fast of a non-Muslim
                nor the imsak of one who has not formed the niyyah is
                acceptable. This is apart from the afore-mentioned conditions of
