            FIQH OF SIYAM (FASTING) IN RAMADHAN
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-1 max-w-2xl text-sm text-black">
            Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the `pillars' of the
            Islamic faith. No proof is required to establish its being
            obligatory (wajib) and one denying it goes out of the fold of Islam,
            because it is obvious like salat, and in respect of anything so
            evidently established both the learned and the unlettered, the
            elderly and the young, all stand on an equal footing. <br />

              the Hijrah upon each and every mukallaf (one capable of carrying
              out religious duties, i.e. a sane adult) and breaking it (iftar)
              is not permissible except for any of the following reasons:</span

                - The schools differ here. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi & Hanbali -</span>
                <br />
                • The four Sunni schools state: If one who is fasting (sa'im)
                falls ill, or fears the aggravation of his illness, or delay in
                recovery, he has the option to fast or refrain. Iftar is not
                incumbent upon him; it is a relaxation and not an obligation in
                this situation. But where there is likelihood of death or loss
                of any of the senses, iftar is obligatory for him and his
                fasting is not valid.
                <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis observe: Fasting is not valid if it would cause
                illness or aggravate it, or intensify the pain, or delay
                recovery, because illness entails harm (darar) and causing harm
                is prohibited (muharram). Moreover, a prohibition concerning an
                `ibadah (a rite of worship) invalidates it. Hence if a person
                fasts in such a condition, his fast is not valid (sahih). A
                predominant likelihood of its resulting in illness or its
                aggravation is sufficient for refraining from fasting. As to
                excessive weakness, it is not a justification for iftar as long
                as it is generally bearable. Hence the extenuating cause is
                illness, not weakness, emaciation or strain, because every duty
                involves hardship and discomfort.

                - The four schools say: If a pregnant or nursing woman fears
                harm for her own health or that of her child, her fasting is
                valid though it is permissible for her to refrain from fasting.
                If she opts for iftar, the schools concur that she is bound to
                perform its make up (qada') later. They differ regarding its
                substitute (fidyah) and atonement (kaffarah). <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanafi -</span> <br />
                • In this regard the Hanafis observe: It is not at all wajib.

                <span class="font-bold">Maliki -</span> <br />
                • The Malikis are of the opinion that it is wajib for a nursing
                woman, not for a pregnant one. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanbali & Shafi -</span> <br />
                • The Hanbalis and the Shafi`is say: Fidyah is wajib upon a
                pregnant and a nursing woman only if they fear danger for the
                child; but if they fear harm for their own health as well as
                that of the child, they are bound to perform the qada' only
                without being required to give fidyah. The fidyah for each day
                is one mudd, which amounts to feeding one needy person
                (miskin.).[Approximately 800 grams of wheat or something similar
                to it.] <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis state: If a pregnant woman nearing childbirth or
                the child of a nursing mother may suffer harm, both of them
                ought to break their fast and it is not valid for them to
                continue fasting due to the impermissibility of harm. They
                concur that both are to perform the qada' as well as give
                fidyah, equalling one mudd, if the harm is feared for the child.
                But if the harm is feared only for her own person, some among
                them observe: She is bound to perform qada' but not to give
                fidyah, others say: She is bound to perform qada' and give
                fidyah as well.

                - The four Sunni schools add a further condition to these:
                <br />
                - The journey should commence before dawn and the traveler
                should have reached the point from where salat becomes qasr
                before dawn. Hence if he commences the journey after the setting
                in of dawn, it is haram for him to break the fast, and if he
                breaks it, its qada' will be wajib upon him without a kaffarah.
                <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Shafi -</span> <br />
                • The Shafi'is add another condition, which is that the
                traveller should not be one who generally travels continuously,
                such as a driver. Thus if he travels habitually, he is not
                entitled to break the fast. <br />
                - In the opinion of the four Sunni schools, breaking the fast is
                optional and not compulsory. Therefore, a traveller who fulfils
                all the conditions has the option of fasting or iftar. This is
                despite the observation of the Hanafis that performing salat as
                qasr during journey is compulsory and not optional. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis say: If the conditions required for praying qasr
                are fulfilled for a traveler, his fast is not acceptable.
                Therefore, if he fasts, he will have to perform the qada'
                without being liable to kaffarah. This is if he starts his
                journey before midday, but if he starts it at midday or later,
                he will keep his fast and in the event of his breaking it will
                be liable to the kaffarah of one who deliberately breaks his
                fast. And if a traveler reaches his hometown, or a place where
                he intends to stay for at least ten days, before midday without
                performing any act that breaks the fast, it is wajib upon him to
                continue fasting, and in the event of his breaking it he will be
                like one who deliberately breaks his fast.

                - There is consensus among all the schools that one suffering
                from a malady of acute thirst can break his fast, and if he can
                carry out its qada' later, it will be wajib upon him without any
                kaffarah, in the opinion of the four schools. In the opinion of
                the Imamis, he should give a mudd by way of kaffarah. The
                schools differ in regard to acute hunger, as to whether it is
                one of the causes permitting iftar, like thirst. <br />

            Conditions (Shurot) of Fasting :
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-1 max-w-2xl text-sm text-black">
            - As mentioned earlier, fasting in the month of Ramadan is wajib for
            each and every mukallaf. Every sane adult (al-baligh al-`aqil) is
            considered mukallaf. Hence fasting is neither wajib upon an insane
            person in the state of insanity nor is it valid if he observes it.
            As to a child, it is not wajib upon him, though valid if observed by
            a mumayyiz. <br />
            Also essential for the validity of the fast are Islam and niyyah
            (intention). Therefore, as per consensus, neither the fast of a
            non-Muslim nor the imsak of one who has not formed the niyyah is
            acceptable. This is apart from the afore-mentioned conditions of
            freedom from menses, puerperal bleeding, illness and travel. <br />

                <span class="font-bold">Hanafi -</span> <br />
                • The Hanafis, an unconscious person is exactly like an insane
                one in this respect, and their opinion regarding the latter is
                that if the insanity lasts through the whole month of Ramadan,
                qada' is not wajib upon him, and if it covers half of the month,
                he will fast for the remaining half and perform the qada' of the
                fasts missed due to insanity. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Maliki -</span> <br />
                • The Malikis state: The fast is not valid if the state of
                unconsciousness or intoxication persists for the whole or most
                of the day from dawn to sunset. But if it covers a half of the
                day or less and he was in possession of his senses at the time
                of making niyyah and did make it, becoming unconscious or
                intoxicated later, qada' is not wajib upon him. The time of
                making niyyah for the fast in their opinion extends from sunset
                to dawn. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Shafi -</span> <br />
                • The Shafi`is observe: His fast is not valid if he is not in
                his senses for the whole period of the fast. But if he is in his
                senses for a part of this period, his fast is valid, although
                the unconscious person is liable to its qada', whatever the
                circumstances, irrespective of whether his unconsciousness is
                self-induced or forced upon him. But the qada' is not wajib upon
                an intoxicated person unless he is personally responsible for
                his state. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanbali -</span> <br />
                • The Hanbalis observe: Qada' is wajib upon a person in a state
                of unconsciousness as well as one in a state of intoxication,
                irrespective of whether these states are self-induced or forced
                upon them. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • In the opinion of the Imamis, qada' is only wajib upon a
                person in an intoxicated state, irrespective of its being
                self-induced or otherwise; it is not wajib upon an unconscious
                person even if his loss of consciousness is brief.

                - Sexual intercourse, when deliberate, invalidates the fast and
                makes one liable to qada' and kaffarah, in the opinion of all
                the schools. <br />
                The kaffarah is the manumission of a slave, and if that is not
                possible, fasting for two consecutive months; if even that is
                not possible, feeding sixty poor persons. The
                <b>Imamis</b> and the <b>Malikis</b> allow an option between any
                one of these; i.e. a mukallaf may choose between freeing a
                slave, fasting or feeding the poor. The
                <b>Shafi'is, Hanbalis and Hanafis</b> impose kaffarah in the
                above-mentioned order; i.e. releasing a slave is specifically
                wajib, and in the event of incapacity fasting becomes wajib.
                <br />
                If that too is not possible, giving food to the poor becomes
                wajib. The <b>Imamis</b> state: All the three kaffarahs become
                wajib together if the act breaking the fast (muftir) is itself
                haram, such as eating anything usurped (maghsub), drinking wine,
                or fornicating. As to sexual intercourse by oversight, it does
                not invalidate the fast in the opinion of the Hanafis, Shafi`is
                and Imamis, but does according to the <b>Hanbalis</b> and the

                The <b>Hanafis</b> state: Deliberate vomiting does not break the
                fast unless the quantity vomited fills the mouth. Two views have
                been narrated from <b>Imam Ahmad</b>. The schools concur that
                involuntary vomiting does not invalidate the fast.
