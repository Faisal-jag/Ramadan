            FIQH OF SIYAM (FASTING) IN RAMADHAN
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-1 max-w-2xl text-sm text-black">
            Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the `pillars' of the
            Islamic faith. No proof is required to establish its being
            obligatory (wajib) and one denying it goes out of the fold of Islam,
            because it is obvious like salat, and in respect of anything so
            evidently established both the learned and the unlettered, the
            elderly and the young, all stand on an equal footing. <br />
            <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold"
              >It was declared an obligatory duty (fard) in the second year of
              the Hijrah upon each and every mukallaf (one capable of carrying
              out religious duties, i.e. a sane adult) and breaking it (iftar)
              is not permissible except for any of the following reasons:</span

                - The schools differ here. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi & Hanbali -</span>
                <br />
                • The four Sunni schools state: If one who is fasting (sa'im)
                falls ill, or fears the aggravation of his illness, or delay in
                recovery, he has the option to fast or refrain. Iftar is not
                incumbent upon him; it is a relaxation and not an obligation in
                this situation. But where there is likelihood of death or loss
                of any of the senses, iftar is obligatory for him and his
                fasting is not valid.
                <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis observe: Fasting is not valid if it would cause
                illness or aggravate it, or intensify the pain, or delay
                recovery, because illness entails harm (darar) and causing harm
                is prohibited (muharram). Moreover, a prohibition concerning an
                `ibadah (a rite of worship) invalidates it. Hence if a person
                fasts in such a condition, his fast is not valid (sahih). A
                predominant likelihood of its resulting in illness or its
                aggravation is sufficient for refraining from fasting. As to
                excessive weakness, it is not a justification for iftar as long
                as it is generally bearable. Hence the extenuating cause is
                illness, not weakness, emaciation or strain, because every duty
                involves hardship and discomfort.

                - The four schools say: If a pregnant or nursing woman fears
                harm for her own health or that of her child, her fasting is
                valid though it is permissible for her to refrain from fasting.
                If she opts for iftar, the schools concur that she is bound to
                perform its make up (qada') later. They differ regarding its
                substitute (fidyah) and atonement (kaffarah). <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanafi -</span> <br />
                • In this regard the Hanafis observe: It is not at all wajib.
                <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Maliki -</span> <br />
                • The Malikis are of the opinion that it is wajib for a nursing
                woman, not for a pregnant one. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanbali & Shafi -</span> <br />
                • The Hanbalis and the Shafi`is say: Fidyah is wajib upon a
                pregnant and a nursing woman only if they fear danger for the
                child; but if they fear harm for their own health as well as
                that of the child, they are bound to perform the qada' only
                without being required to give fidyah. The fidyah for each day
                is one mudd, which amounts to feeding one needy person
                (miskin.).[Approximately 800 grams of wheat or something similar
                to it.] <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis state: If a pregnant woman nearing childbirth or
                the child of a nursing mother may suffer harm, both of them
                ought to break their fast and it is not valid for them to
                continue fasting due to the impermissibility of harm. They
                concur that both are to perform the qada' as well as give
                fidyah, equalling one mudd, if the harm is feared for the child.
                But if the harm is feared only for her own person, some among
                them observe: She is bound to perform qada' but not to give
                fidyah, others say: She is bound to perform qada' and give
                fidyah as well.

                - Travel, provided the conditions necessary for salat al-qasr,
                as mentioned earlier, are fulfilled as per the opinion of each
                school. <br />
                - The four Sunni schools add a further condition to these:
                <br />
                - The journey should commence before dawn and the traveler
                should have reached the point from where salat becomes qasr
                before dawn. Hence if he commences the journey after the setting
                in of dawn, it is haram for him to break the fast, and if he
                breaks it, its qada' will be wajib upon him without a kaffarah.
                <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Shafi -</span> <br />
                • The Shafi'is add another condition, which is that the
                traveller should not be one who generally travels continuously,
                such as a driver. Thus if he travels habitually, he is not
                entitled to break the fast. <br />
                - In the opinion of the four Sunni schools, breaking the fast is
                optional and not compulsory. Therefore, a traveller who fulfils
                all the conditions has the option of fasting or iftar. This is
                despite the observation of the Hanafis that performing salat as
                qasr during journey is compulsory and not optional. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis say: If the conditions required for praying qasr
                are fulfilled for a traveler, his fast is not acceptable.
                Therefore, if he fasts, he will have to perform the qada'
                without being liable to kaffarah. This is if he starts his
                journey before midday, but if he starts it at midday or later,
                he will keep his fast and in the event of his breaking it will
                be liable to the kaffarah of one who deliberately breaks his
                fast. And if a traveler reaches his hometown, or a place where
                he intends to stay for at least ten days, before midday without
                performing any act that breaks the fast, it is wajib upon him to
                continue fasting, and in the event of his breaking it he will be
                like one who deliberately breaks his fast.

                5. Suffering from a malady of acute thirst. <br />
                - There is consensus among all the schools that one suffering
                from a malady of acute thirst can break his fast, and if he can
                carry out its qada' later, it will be wajib upon him without any
                kaffarah, in the opinion of the four schools. In the opinion of
                the Imamis, he should give a mudd by way of kaffarah. The
                schools differ in regard to acute hunger, as to whether it is
                one of the causes permitting iftar, like thirst. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi & Hanbali -</span>
                <br />
                • The four schools say: Hunger and thirst are similar and both
                make iftar permissible. <br />
                <span class="font-bold">Imami -</span> <br />
                • The Imamis state: Hunger is not a cause permitting iftar

                omitted: similarly a sick person who does not hope to recover

                Imamis and the Shafi`is to refrain (imsak) from things that
